## Overview

Loan eligibility prediction is a crucial task for banks and other financial organizations. By leveraging machine learning, this project aims to streamline and enhance the accuracy of the loan approval process. The project takes as input various applicant details and predicts the likelihood of loan approval.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Prediction of loan eligibility based on user input
- Extensible for new features and datasets

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sailappansivan/Loan-eligibility-prediction.git
   cd Loan-eligibility-prediction
   ```

2. **(Optional) Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare your dataset:**  
   Ensure your dataset is in the correct format as expected by the scripts (see project structure).

2. **Run the main script:**  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   (Replace `main.py` with the actual entry-point script if different.)

3. **Model Predictions:**  
   Follow the prompts to input applicant details and receive the loan eligibility prediction.

## Model Training

- The project uses supervised learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
- Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, feature encoding, and normalization.
- Model evaluation is performed using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
